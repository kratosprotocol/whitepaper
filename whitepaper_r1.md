<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<b>Problems with existing protocols</b>

Today's blockchain protocols are at an early stage of development and contain weaknesses that do not fit the growing demands of the market and do not allow us to find practical application of protocols in various aspects of economic and social relations.

Protocols were created at the dawn of the appearance of blockchain technologies by geeks, without regard to embedding in familiar economic principles and did not take into account the peculiarities of financial systems.
Development does not stand still. The market, the state, corporations, consumers need technologies that take into account their requirements and characteristics. New technologies and protocols that can easily be built into the ecosystem, be familiar and find an easy way to integrate into the processes.

The main problems of today's protocols are given below.

<b>Network Bandwidth</b>

Blockchain protocols are beyond the scope of highly specialized technologies. Applied application in finance, public and government sector requires high network capacity.
Financial transactions - a vivid example of the use of blockchain protocols (cryptographic algorithms that exchange information). But for implementation in the real economy, the speed of transactions should be equal in speed to modern systems that are implemented in financial institutions (for example, the theoretical peak transaction rate of Visa is 56,000 operations per second with a maximum real 24.000).

The current protocols did not achieve such indicators. A new flexible generation of protocols can eliminate weaknesses and give impetus to the massive use of blocking technologies.

<b>Network Scaling</b>

Current protocols impose high demands on hardware and software. The chains are linear and the growth of the occupied space causes the holders of the nodes to purchase more expensive disk space. Algorithms for checking the validity and integrity of the blocks make it necessary to acquire more memory and modern processors. The cost of maintaining a node, not to mention the mining, becomes tangible, and the owners of the nodes no longer see the point. Protocol makers come up with solutions to the problem of scaling, but the growth in requirements is ahead of the results of the developments. Additional sources of scaling problems are the linearity of the chain of blocks and the peer-to-peer network.

Linearity of the chain of blocks means that each node receives, checks and stores the entire chain of blocks. Growth of transactions on the network greatly increases the requirements for memory and communication channels. The next-generation protocols should be able to work with network segments, while maintaining the ability to confirm the integrity of the chain.
Network peer-to-peer means that all nodes perform the same role, and accordingly, they have the same requirements that grow with the network.

The solution lies in the separation of network nodes into roles - for different roles, different requirements for resources. Different roles will have different motivations for participating in the formation of the chain.

<b>High concentration of networks</b>

A limited number of participants affects the formation of blocks in the network and creates the risk of manipulation. Facts that call into question the essence of blockchain technologies, where the central element is the mutual confirmation of compliance in the absence of trust. With the increase in requirements for iron, more ordinary people are leaving this sphere and the degree of decentralization is declining.

<b>High cost of network entry</b>

High cost of entry into the ranks of miners. If earlier it was possible to mine on a personal computer, today it has become an industrial business that consumes electricity, comparable to the needs of settlements.

Future protocols should enable users with low computing power, including from mobile devices, to participate in the formation of the network. At the same time, participation in the formation of the network should be compensated. Including those users who did not participate in the processing of transactions and the formation of blocks, but distributed the network or solved the problem of scaling and maintaining the network online. This will be fair and allow for greater decentralization.
