<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<b>Problems with existing protocols</b>

Today's blockchain protocols are at an early stage of development and contain weaknesses that do not fit the growing demands of the market and do not allow us to find practical application of protocols in various aspects of economic and social relations.

Protocols were created at the dawn of the appearance of blockchain technologies by geeks, without regard to embedding in familiar economic principles and did not take into account the peculiarities of financial systems.
Development does not stand still. The market, the state, corporations, consumers need technologies that take into account their requirements and characteristics. New technologies and protocols that can easily be built into the ecosystem, be familiar and find an easy way to integrate into the processes.

The main problems of today's protocols are given below.

<b>Network Bandwidth</b>

Blockchain protocols are beyond the scope of highly specialized technologies. Applied application in finance, public and government sector requires high network capacity.
Financial transactions - a vivid example of the use of blockchain protocols (cryptographic algorithms that exchange information). But for implementation in the real economy, the speed of transactions should be equal in speed to modern systems that are implemented in financial institutions (for example, the theoretical peak transaction rate of Visa is 56,000 operations per second with a maximum real 24.000).

The current protocols did not achieve such indicators. A new flexible generation of protocols can eliminate weaknesses and give impetus to the massive use of blocking technologies.

<b>Network Scaling</b>

Current protocols impose high demands on hardware and software. The chains are linear and the growth of the occupied space causes the holders of the nodes to purchase more expensive disk space. Algorithms for checking the validity and integrity of the blocks make it necessary to acquire more memory and modern processors. The cost of maintaining a node, not to mention the mining, becomes tangible, and the owners of the nodes no longer see the point. Protocol makers come up with solutions to the problem of scaling, but the growth in requirements is ahead of the results of the developments. Additional sources of scaling problems are the linearity of the chain of blocks and the peer-to-peer network.

Linearity of the chain of blocks means that each node receives, checks and stores the entire chain of blocks. Growth of transactions on the network greatly increases the requirements for memory and communication channels. The next-generation protocols should be able to work with network segments, while maintaining the ability to confirm the integrity of the chain.
Network peer-to-peer means that all nodes perform the same role, and accordingly, they have the same requirements that grow with the network.

The solution lies in the separation of network nodes into roles - for different roles, different requirements for resources. Different roles will have different motivations for participating in the formation of the chain.

<b>High concentration of networks</b>

A limited number of participants affects the formation of blocks in the network and creates the risk of manipulation. Facts that call into question the essence of blockchain technologies, where the central element is the mutual confirmation of compliance in the absence of trust. With the increase in requirements for iron, more ordinary people are leaving this sphere and the degree of decentralization is declining.

<b>High cost of network entry</b>

High cost of entry into the ranks of miners. If earlier it was possible to mine on a personal computer, today it has become an industrial business that consumes electricity, comparable to the needs of settlements.

Future protocols should enable users with low computing power, including from mobile devices, to participate in the formation of the network. At the same time, participation in the formation of the network should be compensated. Including those users who did not participate in the processing of transactions and the formation of blocks, but distributed the network or solved the problem of scaling and maintaining the network online. This will be fair and allow for greater decentralization.

<b>A trivial transactional model</b>

Blockchain protocols of the first generation were created mainly for payments by the only digital asset - cryptocurrency. Others are designed for token issuance, exchange and exchange trading. The next generation of protocols is able to send any information in transactions (data transactions).

The architecture of the protocols is not enough for the practical application of block technologies in finance, the public sector and state institutions and requires a completely new view of the transactional model.

The creators of the new generation of protocols should approach systematically to the creation of a transactional model, taking into account the diversity of economic and social relations, as well as requirements for finiteness of calculations and withdrawal of transactions.

<b>Cross-platform</b>

Each created protocol is not designed for interaction with other protocols.
This is solved by additional add-ons or platforms, where the re-tokenization of assets occurs. Re-tokenization of assets, which is performed through a centralized node, carries the risks of asset disappearance.  Other cross-Protocol services are centralized and have the risk of asset loss

<b>Release of tokens</b>

The issue of tokens in the existing protocols is either too complicated for the end user, or simple, but the issued token is severely limited in terms of parameters and network traffic opportunities.
There is no option of giving the tokens a semantic and behavioral logic that approximates them to the usual financial instruments.

<b>Smart contracts</b>

Smart contracts are difficult to create, implement, and use, and too vulnerable. Their implementation requires resources. A new approach to development, debugging, and implementation in the network is needed. Only when simple smart contracts become available to the mass consumer, it will go into circulation and will be used and applied.  A jump in programmable logic on network nodes is needed.

<b>High Volatility</b>

Tokens have a deflationary nature, the volatility of which is not controlled. Blockchain protocols are not protected from speculators ' manipulation. There is no Central Issuer or regulator that has a clear and predictable monetary policy. There is no binding of the token to the value of an external asset. This is due to the decentralization of the network-the issuers are different nodes. The release of new coins to the market is clear and limited to a constant value.

In the time range and the current rhythm of economic relations, new issues are not enough to close the demand for the token. There is uncontrolled growth of quotations that are attracted to this area speculators, which change the essence of the design of the token on the investment. New protocols should be much more flexible and understandable to users and investors, not have an investment character and be a tasty morsel for speculators. This does not mean that the token does not grow in price, but the price growth will not be avalanche-like. At the same time, it is necessary to find a solution to the problem that would not lead to a variant with a centralized Issuer.

<b>Interoperability</b>

Poor code quality and weak integration capabilities. This applies both to the culture of creating stable code and the application of standards for developing enterprise solutions, in which not only the solution is developed, but also security, functional, load, regression, validation, and so on.
In addition to the server and client code is extremely important ecosystem development around the technology: libraries for integration, API, reference materials and documentation, examples, forums and developers chats. It is also important to create a modern and adequate support service.
